Yes, Git can be used with Visual Studio Code to manage version control for your code projects. Here's a brief overview of how Git works in Visual Studio Code:

Install Git: If you haven't already, you'll need to install Git on your computer. You can download it from the official Git website.

Open a project folder: In Visual Studio Code, open the folder for your project that you want to track with Git.

Initialize a Git repository: Once you have opened your project folder, you can initialize a new Git repository. To do this, open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows or Command+Shift+P on macOS, and type "Git: Initialize Repository". This will create a new Git repository in your project folder.

Make changes to your code: As you make changes to your code, Visual Studio Code will track those changes and show you which files have been modified.

Stage and commit changes: When you are ready to commit your changes to the Git repository, you need to stage the changes first. To do this, click on the "Source Control" tab in the sidebar, select the files you want to stage, and click the "+" button next to each file. Once you have staged your changes, you can commit them by clicking the checkmark icon in the "Source Control" tab and entering a commit message.

Push changes to a remote repository: If you want to push your changes to a remote repository, you'll need to first set up a connection to the remote repository. To do this, click on the "Source Control" tab in the sidebar and click the gear icon in the top-right corner. From there, you can select "Add Remote" and enter the URL for your remote repository. Once you have set up a remote connection, you can push your changes to the repository by clicking the three-dot icon in the "Source Control" tab and selecting "Push".

That's a basic overview of how Git works in Visual Studio Code. There are many other features and commands you can use to manage your code projects with Git, such as branching, merging, and reverting changes. Visual Studio Code has a built-in Git extension that makes it easy to use Git and track changes to your code.
